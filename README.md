# Carton
Carton is an advanced web toolchain for experimentation, and small projects. Carton exists as a contrast to [DairyBox](/mikekasprzak/dairybox), for use with similar tools (Buble (ES6), ESLint, SVGO, GNU Make, etc). Unlike DairyBox, carton doesn't use a VM, and doesn't lend itself for use with PHP. It's designed for generating static minimized output, in a style that Mike likes. :wink:

To use Carton, you need:

* A Unix Environment (preferrably Ubuntu, a derivative of Ubuntu, or Ubuntu on Linux for Windows)

Instructions will assume an Ubuntu-esc environment.
